Casanovo Nextflow Workflow Documentation
========================================
This workflow will run an automated workflow developed using Nextflow to convert your raw file (if necessary),
run Casanovo (https://github.com/Noble-Lab/casanovo), and optionally upload to Limelight (https://limelight-ms.org/) for data sharing and visualization. Please use the links below to navigate to pages
describing how to install and run the workflow, how to retrieve results, and how to set up AWS Batch to run the workflow in the cloud.
